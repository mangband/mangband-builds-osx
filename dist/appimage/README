This script will build & bundle a valid AppImage[1], given

- you have linuxdeploy tool
- LINUX_DEPLOY envvar is set to it's path, e.g.:

LINUX_DEPLOY="./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage" ./appit.sh

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HOWEVER! AppImages should be built on oldest possible linux distro,
e.g. CentOS 6, so if you build this on latest Ubuntu, it won't be
of any use to anyone!

Thus, while this script shall work on your machine, and that is
useful for debugging it, please DON'T re-destribute the resulting
appimage!
