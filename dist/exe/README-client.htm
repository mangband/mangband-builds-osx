<h1>Windows MAngband Client</h1>
<p>This is a Microsoft Windows version of the MAngband Client. This is what you need in order to connect to and play on a MAngband server.</p>

<p>This short Readme file does not provide detailed documentation of how to play. If you are new MAngband your first port of call should be <a href="http://www.mangband.org">www.mangband.org</a>.  Be sure to checkout <a href="http://www.mangband.org/help/">the documentation section</a> of the website</p>

<h2>Connecting to a Server</h2>

<h3>Q. How do I connect to a server?</h3>
<p>On the Start Menu, click on <i>Start->Programs->MAngband->MAngband</i>.  Several windows will open up, in the main game window (the one at the top left) a list of servers will be displayed.  Press the letter corresponding to the server you wish to connect to.  New players should almost certainly connect to the official "mangband.org" server, which will be the first item on the list.  For example, if the server list looked like this:</p>
<pre>
  a) mangband.org
  b) variantserver.mangband.org
  c) death.to.morgoth.net
</pre>
<p>You would press <code>a</code> (a lowercase "a") to select the official mangband.org server.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>

<h3>Q. All the windows which open are very small and squashed in the top left of the screen.  Can I make them any bigger?</h3>
<p>Yes.  Depending upon your screen resolution the default setting of the MAngband windows may be too small.  If it is you can make the windows bigger by choosing a bigger font for each one.</p>

<p>In the main MAngband window open the <i>Options</i> menu, then open the <i>Fonts</i> sub menu.  A list of all the currently open MAngband windows is displayed in this menu, select the <i>Main</i> window and a File Open dialog box will open.  Choose one of the fonts available.  You'll have to experiment to see which fonts suit your display best.  Repeat this procedure for each window listed in the <i>Options->Fonts</i> submenu.  Drag the windows around until you're happy with the position.  MAngband will remember where you put them and they will reopen in the same place each time you play.</p>
