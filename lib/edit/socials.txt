# File: socials.txt


# This file is used to initialize "socials" - simple role-playing
# messages. 
# A large portion of those messages was ported from CircleMUD 3.1:
# http://www.circlemud.org/pub/CircleMUD/3.x/uncompressed/circle-3.1/lib/misc/socials

# This file fails silently on any parsing errors, so be careful.

# Z:<total number of socials in this file>
# N:<distance>:<name>
# L:<line>
# F:<double-line>
# E:<triple-line>

# <distance> -- minimal distance to target
#		0 to disable targeted, -1 is a "dir hack"
# <line> -- an appropriate text message. Use "%s" for names
# <double-line> -- transforms into 2 lines of text
#	"$ yawn~." becomes "You yawn." and "%s yawns."
# <triple-line> -- transforms into 3 lines of text
#	"$ look~ at $." becomes "You look at %s.",
#							"%s looks at %s.", and
#							"%s looks at you."

# Each social can contain up to 5 lines of text, defined by either
# a chain of "L"s, or by "F" and/or "E", used in any combination.
# First 2 lines (LL/F) are for argument-less actions,
#   Line 1 specifies what player sees.
#   Line 2 specifies what others around him see.
# Next 3 lines (LLL/E) are for targeted actions. 
#   Line 3 specifies what player sees.
#   Line 2 specifies what others around him see.
#   Line 3 specifies what his victim sees.
