# This file is used to initialize a list of graphics modes

# === Understanding graphics.txt ===

# N: serial number : pref file name : menu name
# I: tile width : tile height : tileset file name
# M: mask file name
# X: alphblending : start row : end row of double high tiles
# T: transperancy : lightmap
# L: level : yoffset : xoffset

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. The pref file name is the name used
# on load to load the right pref file set for this tile set.

# 'I' is for image information - tile width and height are the dimensions,
# in pixels, of an individual tile in the set. filename is the name of the
# image file to load.

# 'M' is for mask file - in case you are using old-school BMPs
# for graphics.

# 'X' is for extra information - alpha is a flag if the tileset needs to use
# alpha blending. double high tiles are ones that have twice the tile height
# as a typical tile. start row is the first row that uses double high tiles.
# End row is the last row that uses double high tiles. start row and end row
# must be greater than 0, if double high tiles are used, and refer to the
# bottom half of the double row.

# 'T' is for MAngband-specific extra information. 'transperancy' indicates
# this tileset has separate layers for terrain and entities and drawing
# one on top of the other is possible. 'lightmap' indicates if this
# tileset supports automatic lighting.

# 'L' is for specifying lighting offsets. 'num' selects light mode
# (0 - torch lit, 1 - los, 2 - lit, 3 - dark), and offset
# values indicate where the new tile lies, relative to original tiles.
